# Waste Detection on the browser using TFLite model
As an initiative to solve for environment, this project is an implementation of detecting various categories of waste in real-time by deploying a TF Lite model directly on the browser using the TFJS-TFLite API.

## Implementation details:
The object detection model was trained on a custom dataset of different categories of waste â€“ **open litter**, **plastic waste**, **biodegradable waste**, **medical waste**, and **overflowing dustbin**.

## Steps to run:

1. Clone the repository on your local machine.
  
2. For static detection, navigate to the directory ```cd Static Detection```; for real-time detection, navigate to the directory ```cd Real-time Detection```.
 
3. Open your terminal/command prompt and enter the command ```py -m http.server``` (if you have Python installed) to create a local server.
   
4. Open your web browser, and go to ```localhost:8000```.
