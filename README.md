# Real-time Waste Detection on the browser using TFLite model
This repository is an implementation of object detection to detect waste in static and real-time directly on the browser using the TFJS-TFLite Web API.

## Implementation details:
The object detection model was trained on a custom dataset of different categories of waste â€“ **open litter**, **plastic waste**, **biodegradable waste**, **medical waste**, and **overflowing dustbin**.

## Static Detection:
